First and foremost, I would like to thank Professor Steingart for ensuring throughout the year that I continually found this project to be a meaningful and enjoyable endeavor. He gave me a great deal of time, guidance and confidence to keep plowing ahead. I also appreciate that Professor Steingart trained me to use first principles to critically evaluate claims made by companies in the energy industry and moreover, engendered in me an inclination to continue approaching novel ideas with ``a whole lot of optimism mixed with a healthy dash of skepticism".

I would like to thank Barry Van Tassel for essentially teaching me how to code. Somehow he is always right. I also need to thank Professor Steingart, Barry and the rest of the lab - Greg Davies, Shoham Bhadra, Ben Herzberg, Mylad Chamoun, Satyajit Phadke, Tanya Gupta, Michael Wang and Aashna Mehra for exceptionally fun conversations, background '90s dance music, a window into life after undergraduate studies and the importance of doing pretty much anything ``for science.''

Finally, I'd like to thank Princeton's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering faculty, staff and teaching assistants for challenging me over the past three years to stretch my technical skillset and then giving me the support that I needed to succeed.
