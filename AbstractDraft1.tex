%Objectives:
%. To design a low-cost frequency response analyzer that can be used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
%use an off-the-shelf digital oscilloscope that cost \$X.
%write the code in python
The main goal of this project was to design a low-cost frequency responser analyzer (FRA) using an off-the-shelf digital oscilloscope and Python software that could execute electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at a lower cost than currently avaialable tools. EIS is an extremely useful technique for numerous applications. Just one application that is growing in importance today is the online, dynamic monitoring of battery cells in electric vehicles and bulk energy storage systems to extend battery life, reduce cost and optimize performance. The FRA is nearly finished, but still needs some further work. In its current state, it can perturb an electrochemical system with a small AC signal of perscribed frequency and amplitude and measure the output of the system. The FRA can also calculate the phase angle of the system's impedance over a range of frequencies, albeit inaccurately.
%Conclusions
%wrote code in python that has easily customizable inputs such as amplitude, frequency, ____.
% tested the code on a series RC circuit. 
%Code can measure phase change and ??gain.
% so far, can't reliably measure phase change. 

%EIS is a technique that measures the impedance of an electrochemical system over a range of frequencies by perturbing the system with a small external current and measuring the voltage drop across the system. 
%Numerous useful system parameters can be extrapolated from the impedance spectrum. Knowledge of these parameters, such as a battery's state of charge, enables the BMS to extend battery pack lifetime, EIS is very useful in a multitude of applications because key properties of electrochemical medium can be extrapolated from the dependence of impedance on frequency.
