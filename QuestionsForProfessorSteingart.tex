1. Scribner associates says one advantage of EIS is that it can verify reaction models. How is it used to verify reaction models?

2. How are equivalent electrical circuits used?
	Is EIS performed on EEC and real electrochemical system to see if the EEC is accurate? And if it is, then what is EEC used for?
3. What does it mean to "match battery cells" i.e. to applications or in space ships?
